# DiscordBotsRedacted

# Most of these bots were just made for **1** server, and weren't public. A lot of the values are hard-coded because of this, since I didn't need any configuration myself.

## GamblingBot
This is a pretty recent unfinished bot that I made for gambling with fake money. I had nothing to do and wated a project like this for a while.

## HostingBot
This is my newest bot that I made for a small hosting company that me and my friend own. It uses the Pterodactyl API to communicate with the panel.
You can create new accounts, testing servers and get the user ID from their email.

## MessageLogger
I started this project a long time ago but haven't used/updated it in a while, so it might be a little bad.

## MusicBot
This bot was all the way back from January this year, when I started a bit with Kotlin. I didn't know a lot back then.
Some of the code is copied from the internet, like some of the music playing. I handled all of the commands and stuff myself though.

## MusicTrivia
This was a small addition for the same server as the other music bot. There is a website for this, where my friends can add their songs to do with the trivia.
Those added songs are stored in a database, and the bot pulls them from there.
